He asked where I lived, I lied even though we were literally in front of my place. He asked for my number, I refused. He kept insisting, straight up begging at some point, I kept saying no. In the end, I told him that I did not want to talk to him, I put my earphones on and turned on my music. He sat next to me for like 10 minutes, before giving up and walking away. It was pretty awkward. » </blockquote>

A guy came to us with his friends and asked for a cigarette. We told him no. He walked away insulting us. "Go fuck your mother" he shouted, so I answered "I'd rather do yours" and my friends told me to stop because they were affraid he might get physically violent.   »</blockquote>

							<blockquote><span class="image left"><i class="fas fa-user-circle"></i></span>« As a woman, I live harrasment quite often. But I will here speak about the worst I think. I was 18years old and I was with my brother (who were only 7 years old at the moment the story took place). I went to pick up him from his nanny and we went to pick up a McDonald’s after that. It was the hollydays so we were at my mother home. When I parked, we got out of the car, I had the McDonald's in one hand and I was holding my brother's hand in the other. So I couldn’t barely move. The street was one way and to reach the house we had to walk down against the car. Then that's where it started, a guy drove in and stopped to our level at my brother and me. He asked me if my brother was my son (Like WTF he was 7 and I was 18 !) , he told me I was beautiful, he wanted my number, etc. I first refused politely, but he insisted. So I continued to walk with my brother and the man began to make a gear with his car to follow us. I tried to ignore him but he began to scream after us and tell me he just wanted to talk with me and learn to know myself. I was really affraid because I was not alone but with my brother who were just a child at the moment. We riched the landing of the house but I didn't want to enter in the house for fear the guy would know where we lived. So I continued to walk to the fork in the street where he could no longer follow us by car. He left and we were finally able to go back home. I'm used to street harassment, but this time the fact that my brother was involved in it really hurted me.  »</blockquote>

Just next to my place, there was this group of men, always hanging out at the same spot. When we  walked by them, they started catcalling us, so I flipped them the bird because I was not in the mood to deal with them. They started screaming insults at my friend and I while we kept walking.   »</blockquote>

I’m a white, male, cis, bi-curious (but wasn’t harrassed for that), 5 years ago, I’ve been punched without any circonstance I’ve been robbed in the street by a group of 6 peoples while going home. Ever since, i don’t feel secure in the street anymore  »</blockquote>

							<blockquote><span class="image left"><i class="fas fa-user-ninja"></i></i></span>« I once, witnessed street harrasment, i was at a bar, with some of my friend, and the table next to our was composed of 2 womens and a drunk man was annoying them. The guys wasn’t aggressiv, but won’t leave them alone, they were clearly annoyed (and this word isn’t strong enough to describe the situation). One of my friend told me, because i didn’t notice it. We then asked the girls if they were ok, they weren’t. In this situation, if you just let it happen, you’re as guilty as the guy who is harrassing people. Don’t be passiv, react, be the creator of a better world. We, my friend and I, stood up and asked the guy to leave. It wasn’t something big for us, it may not be for you, but this changed the end of the night and maybe more for 2 girls. YOU can create security around you.  »</blockquote>
