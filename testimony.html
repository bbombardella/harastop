							<p>« I was just outside my place, smoking on the porch of my building. A guy came and started talking to me. He asked where I lived, I lied even though we were literally in front of my place. He asked for my number, I refused. He kept insisting, straight up begging at some point, I kept saying no. In the end, I told him that I did not want to talk to him, I put my earphones on and turned on my music. He sat next to me for like 10 minutes, before giving up and walking away. It was pretty awkward. » </p>
							<p>« I was with some friends in the street, it was late, probably like 1 AM. A guy came to us with his friends and asked for a cigarette. We told him no. He walked away insulting us. "Go fuck your mother" he shouted, so I answered "I'd rather do yours" and my friends told me to stop because they were affraid he might get physically violent.   »</p>
