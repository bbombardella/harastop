							<h1 class="major">Why do people are aggressiv?</h1>
							
							<p>Sometimes it’s because people are dumb, sometimes because they are not informed, they may not understand others feeling and could be scared about the subject, homophobic behavior may reflect something people want to avoid because of their religion, familial environment etc... about the subject, sometimes because they’re mean. </p>
							<p>But usually, it's just the fear of what people don't understand, discrimination and judgement come from misinformation and fear. This fear can also be lead to something people don't want to assume in themselves : someone who bully and harass people is likely to be gay him/herself</p>
							<p>Group effect can also be involved, in every group there is someone or a specific kind of people that is rejected, in our case, they are peoples from LGBTQ+ community or POC. Individually, people in the group may not agree with the general idee, but they’ll change their behavior to conform the group demands in order to be liked or having the feeling to be right. 
							Group effect may lead an individual to aggressivity, usually someone that as a low self-esteem, pushed by the group to prove something that he don’t have  to, and/or may not agree with</p>
