							<h2 class="minor">Stop harassement</h2>
							<p>In France, there is Street Harassement and it can not be accepted anymore. Aren’t you tired of being afraid while going back home ? Or just being you? You’re not a slut because of your skirt, and your Colour or sexual orientation don’t justify harassement ! </p>
							
							<p>One time, I was walking my friend to the train station. Just next to my place, there was this group of men, always hanging out at the same spot. When we  walked by them, they started catcalling us, so I flipped them the bird because I was not in the mood to deal with them. They started screaming insults at my friend and I while we kept walking. </p>
							
							<p>This story is quite simple, without any consequences, but the group of men could have become violent, and physically assaulted them, keep in my mind that things like that happen everywhere, everyday, and to everyone, he could have been your sister, daughter, mother or your friends. </p>
							
							<h2 class="minor">Who are we</h2>
							
							<p>We are students from University Technology Institute from Lyon, in Computer Science Department, who suffered from  street harassement, and decided to stand up and fight for our right, our right to walk in the street freely, fearless. We are human, like you, but individual action can lead to a mass revolution </p>
							
							<h2 class="minor">Become the Hero of the story </h2>
							
							<p>Honestly, we can’t change people, we can’t avoid harassement, there will always be people with negative intentions. But, we can act, we can change the consequences : when we witness that kind of action, we must act. We can’t let it happen, again and again. Act, and become the hero of your story. </p>
							
							<p>Remember that alone, we are nothing, but human is stronger united, help victim of harassement. We can securize our street.</p>
